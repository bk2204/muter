Muter
=====

Muter is a tool to convert to and from various data formats, such as
hexadecimal, Base64, and URI encoding.

== Use

Muter takes a series of bytes like cat (as filenames or from standard input) and
produces a byte sequence to standard out.  The bytes are modified by the
argument to -c (--chain) that specifies the encodings to perform.

For example, a chain of `-hex:base64` decodes hex input and then re-encodes the
data in Base64.  `base64:uri` would Base64-encode the data, and then URI-encode
it, but `url64` would just encode using the URL-safe version of Base64.
A chain of `hash(sha256):hex` would hash the input data and then hex-encode the
SHA-256 hash.

== Name

Muter comes from the Spanish verb _mudar_ and the French verb _muter_, meaning
_to mutate_, since what it does is, well, mutate data.
