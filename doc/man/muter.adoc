== Name

muter - convert between various formats

== Synopsis

'muter' [--reverse] -c <chain> [fileâ€¦]

== Description

'muter' is a tool to process data by encoding and decoding it in various formats.
The series of transforms being used is described by the chain.

Like most Unix command line tools, 'muter' processes the files specified on the command line, or standard input if no files are specified.
It produces output to standard output.
Input and output are generally assumed to be a series of bytes; where character interpretation is required, UTF-8 is used.

A chain is a series of transforms separated by colons.
A reverse transform (decoding) is specified by preceding the transform with a `-` character.
If a transform takes parameters, they are separated by commas and follow the transform either surrounded by parentheses or preceded by a comma.
Unknown parameters are ignored.

Not all transforms have an reverse transforms.
For example, the 'hash' transform, which implements cryptographic hashes, is not practically invertible (we hope).
An error will be produced if you attempt to use an invalid transform.

Generally, a reverse transform will decode any variant of the forward transform.
To preserve this invariant, related but incompatible transforms such as 'base64' and 'url64' are separate transforms.

In general, 'muter' expects the input to its decoders to be well-formed.
Passing broken or corrupt data will not generally produce useful results.
A strict decoding option may be provided in the future for improved robustness.

== Options

--buffer-size=<size>::
  Specify the buffer size (in bytes) for processing data.
  The default is 65536.
  If this value is set too low for a given codec to make forward progress, an error will be given.
  Currently, no codec _requires_ a buffer size greater than 64 bytes, although using such a small buffer will negatively impact performance.
+
This option is primarily for debugging purposes and need not be adjusted in ordinary use.

-c<chain>::
--chain=<chain>::
  Specify the chain of transforms.
  This option is mandatory.

-r::
--reverse::
  Reverse the chain of transforms and convert each forward transform to a reverse transform, and vice versa.
  Assuming all transforms can be inverted, running an instance of 'muter' without this flag followed by an instance with this flag and with the same chain returns the original data.
+
It is not valid to specify this flag with transforms that have no inverse.

--help::
  List usage and all known transforms.

== Backends

'muter' includes several different backends.
Unless otherwise noted, backends are reversible (that is, they both encode and decode), they round-trip (that is, encoding and decoding produces the same sequence of bytes for all valid values), and all variants of input produced by encoding are accepted when decoding without the need for any options.

Backends that perform compression ('deflate', 'gzip', and 'zlib') are not guaranteed to produce stable output across versions.
They will produce functionally equivalent output, but the exact sequence of bytes may change.
However, a single version of muter will produce _deterministic_ output (that is, it will not include timestamps or other system-specific data).

The following backends are included with muter:

ascii85::
  Implements the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85[Ascii85 encoding].
  If the 'bare' option is provided, the `<~` and `~>` affixes are not included.
base16::
  Equivalent to the 'hex' backend with the 'upper' argument.
  Implements the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648[RFC 4648] Base16 encoding.
base32::
  Implements the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648[RFC 4648] Base32 encoding.
  The options 'pad' (the default) and 'nopad' control whether padding is used.
base32hex::
  Implements the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648[RFC 4648] Base32 with Extended Hex Alphabet encoding, better known as 'base32hex'.
  The options 'pad' (the default) and 'nopad' control whether padding is used.
base64::
  Implements the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648[RFC 4648] Base64 encoding.
  The options 'pad' (the default) and 'nopad' control whether padding is used.
bubblebabble::
  Implements the https://web.mit.edu/kenta/www/one/bubblebabble/spec/jrtrjwzi/draft-huima-01.txt[Bubble Babble] binary data encoding.
checksum::
  Implements a non-cryptographic hash of the input data.
  There is no corresponding reverse transform.
+
The following checksum algorithms are supported:
+
* adler32
crlf::
  Implements an LF to CRLF conversion.
  CR bytes in the input are passed through unmodified.
deflate::
  Implements raw deflate encoding.
form::
  Implements URI percent encoding, like 'uri', except it encodes space as `+` instead of `%20`, as for use in  'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.
  This used to be written `uri(form)`, which is no longer allowed.
+
Otherwise accepts the same options as 'uri' ('lower' and 'upper').
hash::
  Implements a cryptographic hash of the input data.
  There is no corresponding reverse transform.
+
The following hash algorithms are supported:
+
* blake2b
* blake2s
* blake3 (if compiled with the "modern" feature)
* md5
* sha1
* sha224
* sha256
* sha3-224
* sha3-256
* sha3-384
* sha3-512
* sha384
* sha512
+
The 'length' argument may additionally be passed to specify the length in bytes of a BLAKE2 or BLAKE3 hash.
+
Note that both MD5 and SHA-1 are completely insecure and should not be used unless it's unavoidable.
gzip::
  Implements the gzip encoding.
  The encoded value will not contain a file name or timestamp, but such values are accepted (and ignored) when decoding.
hex::
  Implements hex encoding.
  Takes two options, 'lower' and 'upper', that control which type of letters are used.
identity::
  Implements the identity transform.
  Passes through the input unmodified.
lf::
  Adds a newline to the end of the output if it does not already contain one.
  If the 'empty' option is specified, skip adding the newline if there is no output.
  There is no corresponding reverse transform.
modhex::
  Implements the https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-c/Manuals/modhex.1.html[Yubico modhex alphabet].
quotedprintable::
  Implements quoted-printable MIME encoding.
swab::
  Swaps the endianness of bytes in the chunk size specified by the 'length' option.
  The value given must be positive but need not be a power of two.
  There is no corresponding reverse transform; the forward transform is its own inverse.
uri::
  Implements URI percent encoding.
+
Takes two possible options.  'lower' and 'upper' control the type of hex character emitted.
url64::
  Implements the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648[RFC 4648] Base64 Encoding with URL and Filename Safe Alphabet.
  The options 'pad' and 'nopad' (the default) control whether padding is used.
uuencode::
  Implements UUencoding.
  Note that the "begin" and "end" markers are not emitted.
vis::
  Implements the **vis**(3) function found on the BSDs.
  The options supported correspond directly to the constants that function takes.
+
The default encoding, if neither 'cstyle' nor 'octal' is specified, is to encode control characters in the form `\^C`, control characters with the eighth bit set in the form `\M^C`, other characters with the eighth bit in the form `\M-C`, and space and meta-space as octal escapes.
+
The flags 'httpstyle' and 'mimestyle' are not implemented.
Instead, use the 'uri' and 'quotedprintable' encoders.
wrap::
  Implements line wrapping.
  The forward transform wraps lines at 'length' (default 80) characters unless they're already shorter.
  The reverse transforms strips all newlines from the input.
  To wrap using CRLF line endings, use this codec in conjunction with the 'crlf' codec.
+
Note that unlike most other codecs, using the forward and reverse transforms together do not round-trip all data.
xml::
  Implements encoding of XML special characters.
  Note that the reverse transform decodes arbitrary decimal and hexadecimal entities into UTF-8.
zlib::
  Implements the zlib encoding.

== Examples

* `muter -c -base64:uri`
+
Decode the standard input as Base64 and output it, encoding it using URI percent-encoding.
* `muter -r -c -uri:base64`
+
Exactly the same as the above.
* `muter -c -hex:hash(sha256):base64 file`
+
Read from 'file', which contains a single hex-encoded string, hash the result with SHA-256, and encode the result as base64.
This chain could also be written as `-hex:hash,sha256:base64`, which may be easier to type.
